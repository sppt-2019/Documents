# The Case for Research in Game Engine Architecture

This article is a call for researhc into game engines and game development. The authors point out that mordern games are so complex that development without game engines is neigh impossible. In light of this the authors express surprise over the limited research done into game engines and game devlopment. Then the authors present a number of research questions that they consider worthwhile investigating.

  - A unified language of game development
  - Identification of software components that are common to all types of computer games
  - Clear boundaries between game engine (code) and game code
  -  Definition of the role of content creation tools in the game development process and as part of game engines
  -  Identification of links between game genres and game engine architecture
  -  Common components for all types of game engine, allowing the definition of a genre-independent reference architecture
  -  Effects of low-level issues on top-level game engine architecture
  -   ‘Best practice’ for the development of game engines
