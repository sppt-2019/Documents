# Participant 2
## IDE: Visual Studio
---

### F# Task 1: Magnatism
* 02:41 First solution to task using `update`
* 02:43 Shown FRP documentation
* 03:44 Expresses understanding of `ReactTo<>` and handlers
* 04:02 Run it from `start` instead
* 04:49 Participant asked about triggering objects, informed that it is handled under the hood
* 05:15 Asked how to use `ReactTo<>`, understands it but misses lambda expression
* 06:04 Not sure what to `ReactTo`, informed to check list of valid this to react to
* 08:07 No need to create events
* 09:40 Asked to explain `map`, participant correctly explains the `map` function
* 10:42 Cautioned against Visual Studio's type warnings
* 11:29 Thinking about how to move balls towards center
* 12:30 Can't remember method to move game objects towards position __Unity Issue__
* 14:37 Need to get the balls to face the center
* 18:26 A few red lines are present
* 18:32 Misspelled `SerializedField`
* 19:23 Order of `let` and `memember` is fixed in F#
* 20:46 Error couldn't be explained by participant and assistance was provided
* 22:45 Further assistance is provided based on example code
* 23:20 Problem with pipe operator `<|`/`|>`
* 24:50 Lists and arrays are not the same in F#
* 28:05 Last expression in a function is the return value, which caused some confusion
* 30:12 Game objects may not be instantiated outside of `start`
* 31:51 Issue passing arguments to move objects function
* 33:30 assignment complete
* 45:20 assignment complete, but it can't run in Unity

### C# Task 1: Unit Management
* 49:22 Given information about shooter states
* 49:40 Suggests either using a list for each possible state
* 52:17 Missing break statement __hint__
* 1:01:30 assignment complete __Test Setup Error__
* 1:07:04 _KÃ¦den er hoppet helt af nu_ Parallelisation confusion
* 1:11:45 Code example should be easier to understand

### FRP
* Exciting new environment
* Took a while to get a hang of it, even with python experience
* The most difficult is the new, but different way things are done (the paradigme)
* A foreign way to handle events, but could be very useful
* Might be easier to use then C#, but participant can't estimate that
  * However, _events_ do
* Would not use the system in production
  * Even with performance gain, it's usefulness depends on the task at hand
* Participant had never heard of functional programming/functional reactive programming
* Habit is major component
