# Pratical Stuff:

- Tuesday is reserved for external work
- Tobias has company-wide stand up Monday at 10.00
- Working days are other days from 8.00 to 15.00
- We operate with as much flexibility as possible, so changes to working hours are coordinated on a daily basis
- In case of remote work we will coordinate and distribute tasks that are to be completed
- We work by the dont-be-a-dick rule

# Tools:

- Slack will be used for daily communication, file sharing and discussions
- Overleaf is used as the primary Latex editor, we will do some fancy stuff so that git and local IDEs may also be used.
- Github is used for document sharing, code and other project-relevant stuff under the sppt-2019 organization

# Report:
Related work: Survey open-source engines.

- Maybe read books on game engine architecture and core components
- Read Godot or Unreal Engine source code. Create architecture diagrams and see how they map to the theoretical stuff

Pick module in an engine of choice

- Replace with an implementation in another runtime, style, language or paradigm.
- Run benchmarks: Performance or Usability (video or Git history)
- Structured use of video capturing when starting with new languages or in case of changes in the program
- If we decide to put our focus on qualitative work we may tone down the performance aspect and cover that with 'angry physics' macrobenchmark and fps measurements and maybe microbenchmarks
